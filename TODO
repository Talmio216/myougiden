 - query types:
   - guess in order: whole-field, whole-word, partial
   - romaji input
     - and support in guess
   - inflection!
     - and guess
   - whole-word for Japanese (feasible?)

 - data:
   - part-of-speech
   - other edict fields
   - pitch-accent data (from where?)

 - resources:
   - option to auto-compress/decompress database

 - output:
   - color
   - romaji output
     - hep and kun
   - better wrapping for "human" output

 - better documentation
   - group options by theme

 - install script

 - alternative backends?
  - it would be interesting to have some benchmark scripts to compare
    backends:
    - latency: average, median, and variance of all queries, very
      simple queries, and very complex one
    - disk space needed
  - EDICT2 with grep
  - some NoSQL thing?
  - some kind of "full-text search" thing?

 - bugs:
   - tab-display mix senses and glosses.
   - whole-field for entire sense is useless. matching by glosses
     would be better.
