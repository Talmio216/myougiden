 - query types:
   - inflection!
     - and guess
   - whole-word for Japanese (feasible?)

 - data:
   - sense:
     - misc
     - s_inf
     - dial

   - more JMdict fields?
     - reproduce everything in EDICT at the very least.

   - add JMdict date (file timestamp, until they add it to the dtd)

   - clean abbreviations that are not being used

   - don't be entry-centric
     - more fine-grained --frequent
     - support re_restr in readings
     - support stagk, stagr in sense

     - how to do it? EDICT expand entries into many lines:
         半平 [はんぺい] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/
         半平 [はんぺん] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/
         半片 [はんぺん] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/(2) half a slice
     - whereas EDICT2 repeats in-line:
         半片;半平 [はんぺん;はんぺい(半平)] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/(2) (半片 only) half a slice/EntL1010230/
     - EDICT style seems reasonable, but the database schema needs to be
       redesigned.

   - pitch-accent data (from where?)

   - use datafile to store version, paths etc.

 - output:
   - color output:
     - light background mode
   - better wrapping for "human" output
   - auto-pager

 - better documentation
   - tsv output
   - manpage?

 - config file support?
   - option --saveconf

 - improve install script/distutils/updatedb
   - smarter handling of dev vs. installed environments
   - can we make pypi post-uninstall delete database?
   - deb?
   - support rsync JMdict delta

 - alternative backends?
  - better benchmarks to compare them
  - option to auto-compress/decompress database
  - backend: EDICT2 with grep
  - backend: some NoSQL thing?
  - backend: some kind of "full-text search" thing?
