 - query types:
   - guess in order: whole-field, whole-word, partial
   - whole-word search for non-regexp
   - romaji input
     - and support in guess

 - data:
   - part-of-speech
   - other edict fields
   - pitch-accent data (from where?)

 - resources:
   - option to auto-compress/decompress database

 - output:
   - color
   - romaji output
     - hep and kun
   - "human" output with better alignment

 - better documentation
   - group options by theme

 - alternative backends?
  - it would be interesting to have some benchmark scripts to compare
    backends:
    - latency: average, median, and variance of all queries, very
      simple queries, and very complex one
    - disk space needed
  - EDICT2 with grep
  - some NoSQL thing?
  - some kind of "full-text search" thing?
