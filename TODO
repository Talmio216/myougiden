 - query types:
   - romaji input
     - and support in guess
   - inflection!
     - and guess
   - whole-word for Japanese (feasible?)

 - data:
   - 'common' flag like EDICT P
   - sense:
     - misc
     - s_inf
     - dial
   - more JMdict fields?
     - duplicate EDICT at the very least.
   - add JMdict date (file timestamp, until they add it to the dtd)
   - better handling of restrictions
     - re_restr in readings
     - stagk, stagr in sense

     - EDICT expand entries into many lines:
         半平 [はんぺい] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/
         半平 [はんぺん] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/
         半片 [はんぺん] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/(2) half a slice
     - EDICT2 repeats in-line:
         半片;半平 [はんぺん;はんぺい(半平)] /(n) (1) (uk) pounded fish cake/(2) (半片 only) half a slice/EntL1010230/
     - EDICT style seems reasonable, but it would require changing the
       entry-centric database schema.


   - pitch-accent data (from where?)

 - output:
   - color output:
     - light background mode
   - romaji output
     - hep and kun
   - better wrapping for "human" output
   - auto-pager
   - tsv output:
     - document
     - is this way the best of represeting senses/glosses?

 - better documentation

 - config file
   - option --saveconf

 - improve install script/distutils/updatedb
   - smarter handling of dev vs. installed environments
   - can we make pypi post-uninstall delete database?
   - deb?
   - "lock" database during update

 - alternative backends?
  - better benchmarks to compare them
  - option to auto-compress/decompress database
  - backend: EDICT2 with grep
  - backend: some NoSQL thing?
  - backend: some kind of "full-text search" thing?

 - expat parser:
   - is still parsing entities
