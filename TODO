 - query types:
   - inflection!
     - and guess
     - if only there was Mecab for Python 3...
   - whole-word for Japanese (feasible?)

 - data:
   - be sure we cover everything covered in EDICT 1, at the very least.

   - smarter handling of restrictions
     - the current model that expands entries with re_restr, stagk, stagr into
       many is workable, but can be cumbersome (e.g. too many entries for
       紅葉).  there must be a better way of doing this.
     - support re_nokanji (how?)

   - clean abbreviations that are not being used

   - more fine-grained --frequent (support ke_pri, re_pri)

 - go beyond JMdict
   - pitch-accent data (from where?)
   - names (JMnedict)?
   - famous people/place names from wikipedia etc?
   - order by frequency?

 - output:
   - better wrapping for "human" output
   - error handling:
     - pretty message when download fails
   - colored --help!

 - better documentation
   - tsv output
   - manpage?

 - config file support?
   - and option --saveconf

 - improve install script/distutils/updatedb
   - better handling of dev vs. installed environments
   - can we make pypi post-uninstall delete database?
   - deb?

 - localization
   - Japanese interface

 - alternative backends?
  - better benchmarks to compare them
  - option to auto-compress/decompress database
  - backend: EDICT2 with grep
  - backend: some NoSQL thing?
  - backend: some kind of "full-text search" thing?
  - DICT protocol?
